## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

An employee directory built with React. The UI is broken into three main components; a search results container, a search form, and a results list. Each is sytled with its own custon css, as well as Bootstrap classes, and font awesome icons. The user is able to sort the table by name, email, or phone, as well as filter users by name via a search input form contained within the search form component.

Other techniques used include the map method, to render the list of random users, ternary operators in several of the sort methods, as well as the use of template literals to remove special characters from user phone numbers. The most challenging aspect was to 're-render' users once the list had been filtered via the search field.
